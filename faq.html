        <dt id="1">When did Rise Against start?</dt>
        <dd><a href="#top">top</a></dd>
        <dd>The band was formed in 1999, under the original name Transistor Revolt. After signing a recording contract with Fat Wreck Chords, they changed their name to Rise Against, 
            and released The Unraveling in 2001, and Revolutions Per Minute in 2003. Rise Against switched to Geffen Records the following year, and made its major record label debut 
            with Siren Song of the Counter Culture. In addition to becoming the band's first album to reach the Billboard 200, where it peaked at number 136, the success of the singles
            "Give It All" and "Swing Life Away" helped Rise Against achieve mainstream appeal.</dd>
        <dt id="2">What year did Rise Against release Appeal to Reason?</dt>
        <dd><a href="#top">top</a></dd>
        <dd>Rise Against's popularity continued to grow with its fifth album Appeal to Reason, released in 2008 by DGC and Interscope Records. The album charted highly, and sold over 
            482,000 copies by 2011. The third single from Appeal to Reason, "Savior", held the record for the most consecutive weeks spent on both the Hot Rock Songs and Alternative Songs 
            charts, with sixty-three and sixty-five weeks respectively. The album produced three singles: "Re-Education (Through Labor)", "Audience of One", and "Savior". All three songs 
            charted highly on the Modern Rock Tracks chart; "Savior" in particular, held the record for the most consecutive weeks spent on both the Hot Rock Songs and Modern Rock Tracks 
            charts, with sixty-three and sixty-five weeks respectively.</dd>
        <dt id="3">What is Rise Against's newest album?</dt>
        <dd><a href="#top">top</a></dd>
        <dd>News of a new Rise Against album began to surface in early 2021 when the band began posting cryptic videos on their social media accounts. These videos eventually lead to the 
            announcement of Nowhere Generation on March 17, 2021. Along with "Broken Dreams, Inc" being included on the track list, the band also released the title track as the second 
            single. Additional singles, "The Numbers" and "Talking to Ourselves" were also released prior to the album, which released on June 4, 2021. The band embarked on a US tour in 
            support of the album that summer with the Descendents and The Menzingers as opening acts. This was followed by multiple 2022 tours with Billy Talent, The Used, Senses Fail, 
            Pennywise, and Stick To Your Guns.</dd>
        <dt id="4">What genre of music is Rise Against?</dt>
        <dd><a href="#top">top</a></dd>
        <dd>Critics have described Rise Against's musical style as punk rock, hardcore punk and melodic hardcore. The band's songs emphasize melody, catchy hooks, aggressive movements, 
            and rapid-paced tempo. Guitarists McIlrath and Blair focus on speed riffing and multi-layered choruses, while bassist Principe uses aggressive picking to lock in with the 
            snare and kick of the drums. Likewise, drummer Barnes follows the guitars, stating: "Sometimes I'll do it naturally, or we'll talk about different ways to accent things - fills 
            from the snare or toms, or some big crashes." The band members have noted the influence of several punk bands, in particular Black Flag and Minor Threat.</dd>
        <dt id="5">What is Rise Against known for?</dt>
        <dd><a href="#top">top</a></dd>
        <dd>Rise Against is known for their outspoken social commentary, which often permeates their lyrics. Throughout the years, the band has discussed a wide range of topics, 
            including animal rights, economic injustice, environmental disasters, forced displacement, homophobia, and modern warfare. Political corruption is another subject commonly 
            found in their lyrics, and as a result, Rise Against is often labeled as a "political band". Some journalists have stated that the band has specifically targeted the 
            Republican administrations of George W. Bush and Donald Trump, while promoting anarchist ideologies.</dd>
        <dt id="6">Is Rise Against's Endgame album selling out?</dt>
        <dd><a href="#top">top</a></dd>
        <dd> Endgame continues the trend by Rise Against towards more crisp, polished production, which began with the band's previous album Appeal to Reason, though with the introduction 
            of heavy metal influences in Zach Blair's guitar playing, something that would stick with the band's sound going forward. Social and political commentary constitute the majority 
            of the lyrical content on Endgame, and a major theme revolves around the end of humanity. After a lengthy tour in support of Appeal to Reason, Rise Against began recording Endgame 
            in September 2010, with producers Bill Stevenson and Jason Livermore. Endgame debuted at number two on the Billboard 200, with 85,000 copies sold in its first week. It holds the 
            record for the band's highest position on the chart. The album also charted highly in several other countries such as Canada, where it became Rise Against's second consecutive 
            album to reach number one on the Canadian Albums Chart.</dd>
        <dt id="7">What's the Sufferer & the Witness?</dt>
        <dd><a href="#top">top</a></dd>
        <dd>The Sufferer & the Witness finds Rise Against continuing on the path begun on 2004's well-received Siren Song of the Counter Culture. Their melodic hardcore may still sound 
            more mainstream accessible, but this can hardly be looked at as a bad thing. After all, the band's sincerity and passion emerge very much intact -- their socially conscious 
            approach no less pressing -- and new and old fans alike should take to Sufferer with open arms. With producers Bill Stevenson and Jason Livermore manning the controls this 
            time around, the band's inner grit is aptly drawn out amid all the pit-ready choruses and fist-in-the-air, stirring lyrics. As such, Rise Against continue to muscularly confront 
            political and personal grievances to the tune of swirling guitars, assertive rhythms, and Tim McIlrath's sandpapered vocals</dd>
        <dt id="8">Who is Rise Against?</dt>
        <dd><a href="#top">top</a></dd>
        <dd>Rise Against is an American punk rock band from Chicago, formed in 1999. The group's current line-up comprises vocalist/rhythm guitarist Tim McIlrath, lead guitarist Zach Blair, 
            bassist Joe Principe and drummer Brandon Barnes. Rooted in hardcore punk and melodic hardcore, Rise Against's music emphasizes melody, catchy hooks, an aggressive sound and 
            playstyle, and rapid tempos.</dd>

         <article>
            <h3>Formation and early years</h3>
            <p>Before Rise Against, guitarist Dan Wleklinski and bassist Joe Principe were members of the Chicago punk rock band 88 
                Fingers Louie, but it disbanded in the late 1990's. In 1999, Principe and Wleklinski decided to form their own punk rock band called
                Transistor Revolt, and recruited guitarist Kevin White, drummed Tony Tintari, and lead vocalist Tim Mcllarath.
                In 2000, the band attracted the attention of the local punk community, as well as Fat Mike, co-founder of the independent record label Fat Wreck Chords. Fat mike offered 
                to sign a recording contract under the condition that they would have to change their name. To which the band agreed and changed to Rise Against. 
                After signed with Fat wreck Chords, Tintari and White left the band. Who were replaced later on in the year by drummer Brandon Barnes and guitarist Todd Mohney.
                In 2001, they released their debut album <strong> The Unravelling </strong> and spent the rest of the year touring. While on the tour, Wleklinski left the band. In December 2002, they band returned to 
                the studio to work on their second album, <strong>Revolutions Per Minute </strong>that was released on April 8, 2003.

            <p>After the released of <strong> Revolutions Per Minute</strong>, a number of major record labels became interested, including DreamWorks Records. The band ended up signing with 
                DreamWorks in late 2003, but DreamWorks was shortly absordeb by the Universal Music Group, and eventually folden into Geffen Records. During this period, Todd Mohney

                After months of touring, the band re-enter the studio and recorded their fourth album, <strong> The Sufferer & the Witness</strong> that was released on July 4, 2006, peaking at number ten
                on the Billboard 200. In 2007 Chasse left the band and Zach Blair joined shortly thereafter as the lead guitarist. Rise Against released their fifth album <strong>Appeal to Reason</strong> on 
                October 7, 2008,  the album peaked at number three on the Billboard 200. Also, it was their first album to commercial success internationally. The album peaked in several coutries, 
                including number seven in Australia, number twenty-one in Germany, number one in canada, number thirty-four in New Zeland, number Fifty-one in Sweden, number forty- in Switzeland,
                and number sixty-eight in the United kingdom. Three songs from <strong>Appeal to Reason</strong> were released as singles: <em>"Re-Education (Throught Labor)", "Audience of One",</em> and <em>"Savior". </em>
